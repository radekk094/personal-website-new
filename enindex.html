                    <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are different opinions about JavaScript. For me, this language is very intuitive. Even if
                        I have a problem, I can usually solve it very quickly with the help of a friendly browser
                        console.

                    <h3>React</h3>
                    <p>
                        Initially, the React library seemed a bit complicated to me, but I changed my mind very quickly.
                        What surprised me the most was the almost limitless possibilities of creating components and the
                        fully automated applications rendering.

                    <h3>JQuery</h3>
                    <p>
                        I can use the most important functions of the JQuery library. To build more extensive
                        applications, I think the React library is more valuable to learn, but JQuery is still great
                        to create simpler applications or interactive websites - especially when there is a need for
                        frequent communication with the DOM.

                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                        At the moment I know the HTML syntax at a good level. I try to write website structures in
                        accordance with HTML5 standards. I use semantic tags to build layouts. Currently, I learn how to
                        add classes according to the BEM method.

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                        CSS is a technology that will probably always surprise me with new solutions. Recently, I have
                        learned how to use animations, how to build page elements using flexboxes and the basics of CSS
                        grid. Creating this website was a very good practice for me of these functions.

                    </div>
                    <h3>SASS</h3>
                    <p>
                        I have learned the SASS preprocessor some time ago, but in the SCSS syntax, because indentation
                        syntax had always been for me less transparent than the brace syntax. However, I recently
                        learned the syntax of "pure" SASS, which I also practiced writing this website.

                    <h3>Bootstrap</h3>
                    <p>
                        Currently, more than half of visits to websites are visits from mobile devices. That is why I
                        recently took a lot of time to learn issues related to RWD. Bootstrap is a great help in
                        creating responsive websites and that is why I currently learn using this framework, but I have
                        not used it yet in projects.

                    <p>
                        At the moment, I only know the basics of PHP, because I am at the beginning of my adventure with
                        programming, and at the moment I focused primarily on frontend technologies.

                                this website. After learning animation in CSS, flexboxes and JQuery, I decided to
                                practice my newly acquired skills. I styled the application in the syntax of "pure"
                                SASS, according to the "mobile first" rule.

                                The application is used to convert the entered amount to a word form, which is very
                                often used in invoice and bill templates. The application was developed in the
                                "create-react-app" environment and the data was prepared by me in a separate file in
                                JSON format.

                        The React library made me so interested that Redux is number 1 on my list of technologies that I
                        want to learn in the near future.

                    <p>
                        At the moment, I focused primarily on learning frontend technologies, but in the future I would
                        like to be able to work also on the application backend. Because of my sympathy for JS and
                        React, I would like to learn how to work with NodeJS.

                    <p>
                        I do not know Angular at the moment, but I have heard from many people that this is a very good
                        framework for working on larger projects, but it is also a bit more difficult than React. That
                        is why I started learning with React, but I would like to learn also this framework in the
                        future.
